									<span>All places yield to him ere he sits down;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the nobility of Rome are his:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The senators and patricians love him too:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To expel him thence. I think he’ll be to Rome</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By sovereignty of nature. First he was</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A noble servant to them; but he could not</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Carry his honours even: whether ’twas pride,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which out of daily fortune ever taints</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The happy man; whether defect of judgment,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To fail in the disposing of those chances</span>

									<span>Not to be other than one thing, not moving</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace</span>

									<span>Even with the same austerity and garb</span>

									<span>For I dare so far free him⁠—made him fear’d,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So hated, and so banish’d: but he has a merit,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lie in the interpretation of the time:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And power, unto itself most commendable,</span>

									<span>Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To extol what it hath done.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.</span>
									<br/>
