					<p>When the First Folio was first published, a deficiency was discovered in act two, scene three of this play. Due to Shakespeare’s close adherence to Plutarch’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Parallel Lives</i>, editors were able to develop a solution for this gap. The two most popular corrections for the missing content are:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
									<span>And [Censorinus,] nobly named so,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Twice being [by the people chosen] censor,</span>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<span>[And Censorinus that was so surnamed]</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And nobly named so, twice being censor,</span>
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</blockquote>
					<p>The former is found in Clark and Wright’s 1887 Victoria edition, and the latter can be found in editions corrected by Dover Wilson. <cite>—⁠<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">S.E.</abbr> Editor</cite> <a href="act-2.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
